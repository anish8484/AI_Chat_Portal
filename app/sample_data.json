          "content": "Python's `async/await` enables writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous:\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **Coroutines** - Functions defined with `async def`\n```python\nasync def fetch_data():\n    # Asynchronous function\n    return data\n```\n\n2. **await** - Pauses execution until async operation completes\n```python\nresult = await fetch_data()\n```\n\n3. **Event Loop** - Manages and executes async tasks\n```python\nimport asyncio\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n- When you `await` an operation, the function yields control\n- The event loop can run other tasks while waiting\n- No blocking - efficient use of resources\n- Perfect for I/O-bound operations (API calls, file operations, database queries)\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def fetch_user(user_id):\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulates API call\n    return {\"id\": user_id, \"name\": \"John\"}\n\nasync def main():\n    # Run multiple tasks concurrently\n    users = await asyncio.gather(\n        fetch_user(1),\n        fetch_user(2),\n        fetch_user(3)\n    )\n    return users\n\n# Run the async function\nresult = asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Non-blocking I/O operations\n- Better performance for concurrent tasks\n- More readable than callbacks\n- Efficient resource usage",
